# Rust Implementation of Binius

This repository contains a Rust implementation of Binius, inspired by Vitalik Buterin's Python version from the Ethereum research repository. The original Python implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/binius/packed_binius.py).

## Purpose

This Rust version has been developed primarily for research purposes. It aims to provide an easy-to-read and efficient adaptation of the original Python code, leveraging Rust's performance and safety features.

## Getting Started

To run this project, make sure you have Rust installed. You can build and run the code using the following commands:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
